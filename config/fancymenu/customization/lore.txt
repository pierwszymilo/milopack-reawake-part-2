Our civilization didn't develop in the same times you grew up. %n%In fact, the people who started the technological revolution were from the future. %n%They went back in time to prevent a catastrophe from happening.%n%Now as the timeline has changed dramatically, it is no longer going to happen.%n%We might say we are saved, but...%n%The civilization is not living in the right era.%n%You will wake up soon in the times we desired to live in.%n%Your job is to create everything we had from the start in the new, better times.%n%Whole knowledge of our civilization is in your disposal,%n%Good Luck.
